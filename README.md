[Hello and thanks for buying the script :) You can't imagine how grateful I am.]

In order to have the script 100% functional you should  go to config.lua and put in there your own webhook (if you want) and change everything you really need

After that the script will be functional, and for any problem or question you should always contact me on discord: :)

Thanks for everything and have a nice day :D
